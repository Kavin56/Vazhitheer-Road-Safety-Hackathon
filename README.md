# Road Safety AI Animation Framework

## Overview
This project leverages state-of-the-art AI tools to create realistic 3D animations for road safety training. By combining **Azure OpenAI Services for DALL-E 3**, **EasyAnimate V5**, **Python with Blender**, and **Open3D**, this framework generates immersive animations that simulate real-world road conditions. The ultimate goal is to improve road safety awareness through interactive and engaging simulations.

## Key Features
1. **Azure OpenAI Services (DALL-E 3)**  
   - **Purpose**: Generates high-resolution, photorealistic 3D images based on text prompts.
   - **Use Cases**: Create varied road safety scenarios, including weather conditions, vehicle types, and urban or rural settings.
   - **Integration**: Provides the foundational 3D scenes for further animation and refinement.

2. **EasyAnimate V5**  
   - **Purpose**: Converts static 3D images into detailed animations with realistic physics.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Simulates vehicle dynamics, collisions, and environmental effects.
     - Ensures smooth transitions in animations, even in complex scenarios.
     - Customizable parameters, such as crash angles and vehicle speeds.
   - **Integration**: Adds life-like motion to static images generated by DALL-E 3.

3. **Python with Blender**  
   - **Purpose**: Refines and renders 3D images and animations to enhance realism.
   - **Key Tools**: Blender's **Cycles** and **Eevee** rendering engines.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Refines textures, lighting, and shading.
     - Adds visual effects like smoke, sparks, and weather impacts.
   - **Integration**: Bridges AI-generated content and final video output.

4. **Open3D**  
   - **Purpose**: Processes and visualizes 3D data.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Refines 3D meshes and geometries.
     - Enhances spatial accuracy and supports interactive visualizations.
   - **Integration**: Ensures high-quality geometry for the generated animations.

## Project Goals
1. Compare and evaluate these technologies to determine the best fit for road safety animation.
2. Develop a unified pipeline that integrates these tools for seamless 3D scene generation and animation.
3. Create engaging road safety scenarios for training and awareness campaigns.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Azure OpenAI subscription with access to DALL-E 3
- CUDA 11.8+ (if using GPU)
- Pytorch 2.2.0
- Blender 3.x
- 60 GB of free disk space (for model weights)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/road-safety-animation.git
   cd road-safety-animation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Azure OpenAI Services**
   - Sign up and obtain an API key from [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/).
   - Update the `config.py` file with your Azure API key and endpoint.

4. **Download Additional Model Weights**
   Place weights in the `models/` directory:
   - EasyAnimate V5: [Hugging Face Link](https://huggingface.co/alibaba-pai/EasyAnimateV5-12b-zh-InP)

5. **Run the Application**
   For AI generation:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   For Blender scripts:
   ```bash
   blender --python script.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Generate 3D Scenes**: Use Azure OpenAI's DALL-E 3 to generate base 3D visuals by providing detailed textual prompts.
2. **Refine Scenes**: Process the generated visuals in Blender to adjust textures, lighting, and effects.
3. **Animate Scenes**: Use EasyAnimate or Open3D to add motion and interactivity to the refined scenes.
4. **Evaluate and Compare**: Assess the output for realism and usability in road safety simulations.

## Future Directions
- Automate the end-to-end pipeline for increased efficiency.
- Add support for real-time scenario adjustments during training sessions.
- Expand to include additional AI-based video generation tools.
